# Task 2: Multiple Sites Architecture and Deployment Efficiency

## General details
Your organization manages approximately 100 websites across various projects : WordPress , simple HTML, and React-based sites. Each website is hosted on its dedicated VPS. Certain functionalities, such as contact forms and their behaviors, need to be consistently implemented across a large group of sites but not on all of them. The other functionality of popup should be also implemented on a group of sites.

### Task
1. **Architectural Design**
* Recommend an architecture that facilitates seamless implementation of changes
across multiple websites.


2. **Standard Functionality Implementation**
* Outline a method to expedite the process of adding standard functionalities when creating a new website from scratch.
* Address how you intend to reduce the time and effort required for integrating common features across different sites.


3. **Scalability and Performance Management**
* Describe how the new architecture will ensure scalability, especially when adding
new websites or accommodating increased traffic.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
* Discuss your strategy for monitoring the performance of all websites and implementing alert systems to promptly address any issues that may arise.



## Solution

1. **Architectural Design**
We'll utilize a microservices architecture combined with a centralized configuration management system.

* Microservices Architecture:
Break down common functionalities such as contact forms and popups into separate microservices. Each website would be treated as a separate microservice. This approach allows for flexibility in terms of technology stack, deployment, and scaling. The microservices architecture would be implemented using containers, such as Docker, to ensure consistency and isolation between websites.

* Shared Library:
A shared library would be created to house common functionalities like contact forms and popups. This library would be versioned and updated independently of the individual websites. When a new version of the library is released, it can be easily integrated into the websites that require the updated functionality.

* Centralized Configuration Management:
Store configuration settings for common functionalities in a centralized configuration management system like Consul or etcd.
Websites can fetch configurations dynamically from the centralized system during runtime, allowing for easy updates and modifications.


2. **Standard Functionality Implementation**
We'll implement a standardized approach to expedite the process of adding standard functionalities when creating a new website from scratch.

* Develop a template engine or starter kits for different types of websites (WordPress, simple HTML, React-based) that include common functionalities.
* Developers can use these templates as a starting point, reducing the time and effort required to integrate common features across different sites.


3. **Scalability and Performance Management**
We'll ensure scalability, especially when adding new websites or accommodating increased traffic.

* Containerization and Orchestration:
Containerize each website using technologies like Docker.
Utilize container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or AWS Auto Scaling to manage and scale containers dynamically based on demand. These mechanisms would automatically add or remove instances of the websites based on predefined rules and thresholds.

* Load Balancing:
Implement load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of each website.
Autoscaling configurations can be set up to automatically add or remove instances based on traffic patterns.

* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
To ensure seamless implementation of changes across multiple websites, a CI/CD pipeline can be implemented using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD. This pipeline would be responsible for building, testing, and deploying the updated code to the respective websites.

* Security: To ensure the security of all websites, a security-first approach can be taken. This approach would involve implementing security measures like HTTPS, secure headers, and regular security audits. Additionally, a security-as-code approach can be used to manage security configurations across all websites.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
We'll implement a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system to promptly address any issues that may arise.

* Monitoring Tools:
Utilize monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to monitor the performance of all websites.
Monitor metrics such as response time, error rate, and resource utilization.

* Alerting System:
Set up alerting rules based on predefined thresholds for critical metrics.
Integrate alerting mechanisms with communication channels like Slack or email to notify relevant stakeholders in real-time.





By implementing this architecture, we can streamline the process of managing multiple websites, ensure consistency in functionalities across sites, improve scalability and performance, and effectively monitor and address any issues that may arise.
